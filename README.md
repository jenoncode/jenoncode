## Hi, I'm Jen!

:sunglasses: A self-taught web developer and proud Black CodHer Coding Bootcamp graduate of Black CodHer alumni.<br/>
:leaves: I love spending time in nature and being surrounded by beauty and the serenity of forests, such a great stress reliever and brings me joy.<br/>
:books: Studied front-end web development at Black CodHer Coding Bootcamp, and I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.js.<br/>
:sparkles: Currently coding interest-based and other projects that are outside of my comfort zone and learning new things. I believe in the abundance of opportunities that a career in coding has to offer, and I welcome the opportunities with open arms.<br/>
:notebook_with_decorative_cover: Currently learning about UI and using PenPot to understand how the User interface contributes to responsive web design.<br/>
:grinning: Fun fact: I went birdwatching when I lived in Sweden, and it was a relaxing experience.
